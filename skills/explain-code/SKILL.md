# Explain Code Skill

The codebase can be of the following types:
1. User-facing software
2. Database
3. Data analysis
4. Algorithms/Models

You will explain different types of codebases in different ways.

## Instruction
Follow the steps to describe the codebase:
1. Identify the codebase type.
2. Follow specific instructions for different codebase types.

### User-facing software

When explaining code for user-facing software, always include:

1. **Start with an analogy**: Compare the code to something from everyday life
2. **Draw a diagram**: Use ASCII art to show the flow, structure, or relationships
3. **Walk through the code**: Explain step-by-step what happens
4. **Highlight a gotcha**: What's a common mistake or misconception?

### Database

When explaining a database, always include:

1. **Describe the database**: Start with describing the database, including the data sources, database information, benefits of the database
2. **FLow of data**: Explain the input source, input data type, the general description of data processing, and the output format.
3. **Draw a diagram**: Use ASCII art to show the flow of data, intermediate processing steps, and processed output files.
4. **Walk through the data processing**: Explain step-by-step what each input data type is, how they are processed (including complex intermediate cross-referencing, merging, filtering, etc.), what each output file is about.

### Data Analysis

When explaining a codebase for data analysis, always include:

1. **Start with an intuitive explanation**: Explain in plain English with intuitive daily life analogy about the purpose the analysis. Explain the goal or hypothesis of the analysis.
2. **High-level experimental setup**: Describe the experimental design and how the setup helps achieve the goal or test the hypothesis.
3. **Draw a diagram**: Use ASCII art to show the experimental design, including the input, data processing, feature engineering, analysis, and the expected output.

### Algorithms and Models

When explaining a codebase about an algorithms or models, always include:

1. **Start with an intuitive explanation**: Explain in plain English with intuitive daily life analogy about the idea of the algorithm. 
2. **High-level design idea**: Describe the algorithm design and how the design helps achieve the goal.
3. **Draw a diagram**: Use ASCII art to show the algorithm/model design, including the input, algorithm architecture, and the expected output.

Keep explanations conversational. For complex concepts, use multiple analogies.
